![RinAI Multimodal UX](https://github.com/dleerdefi/rinai-multimodal-vtuber/blob/main/assets/images/RinAI%20Multimodal%20UX%20Example.png)

ü§ñ  RinAI is an open-source multi-modal desktop agent that combines speech processing, LLMs, tool automation, state machines and NEAR Intents for cross-chain trading and limit order scheduling. Features include:

- üéôÔ∏è Real-time STT/TTS with Groq & 11Labs
- üí∏ Near Intents Integration
- üê¶ Twitter scheduling & automation
- üß† GraphRAG memory system
- üîß Extensible tool framework
- üéÆ VTube Studio integration
- üí¨ YouTube chat interaction
- üê•ElizaOS Twitter Client Integration

RinAI is built with Python, TypeScript, modern AI services, and integration with the [NEAR Intents solver bus api](https://docs.near-intents.org/near-intents).

## Key Features

*   **NEAR Intents Integrations:** Integration with the NEAR Intents solver bus enables cross chain swaps on from a users near wallet
*   **Hierarchical State Machines:** State machines allow for sensitive workflows to be managed securely
*   **Approval Manager:** Approval can be implemented for tasks to provide valuable oversight to agent workflows
*   **Multimodal AI:** Integrates speech-to-text, text-to-speech, large language models, and tool calling for rich and interactive conversations.
*   **Live Streaming Ready:** Designed for V-Tubing! Operate fully autonomously, engaging directly with chat or with a live host using speech-to-text.
*   **Desktop Agent:** Operate fully autonomously, engaging directly with chat or with a live host using speech-to-text.
*   **Ultra-Fast Speech Processing:** Utilizes Groq for Whisper AI, delivering lightning-fast and reliable speech-to-text transcription.
*   **Tool-Calling Powerhouse:** Equipped with tools including:
*   **Limit Order Agent:** Use Near intents to schedule limit orders and swap across multiple chains
    *   **Twitter Agent:** Create and schedule tweets

5. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   # Clone main repository
   git clone [Your Main RinAI Multimodal Intents Agent Repo URL] rinai-multimodal-Intents-agent
   cd rinai-multimodal-Intents-agent

   # Setup Python environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Setup Twitter API Client
   git clone [Your Forked ElizaOS Twitter Client Repo URL] twitter-client
   cd twitter-client
   npm install
   ```

6. **Starting the Services:**

   a. Start the Twitter API Server:
   ```bash
   cd twitter-client
   npx ts-node server.ts  # Or the correct server startup file
   ```
   - Verify the server is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

   b. Start the Main RinAI Server:
   ```bash
   cd rinai-multimodal-Intents-agent
   python src/scripts/run_stream.py
   ```
   Follow the prompts to:
   - Choose between streaming or local agent mode
   - Select your microphone device
   - Enable/disable YouTube chat (if streaming)

   c. Access the Web Interface:
   - Open your browser to [http://localhost:8765](http://localhost:8765)
   - You should see the retro-style chat interface
   - Messages will appear as they're processed

   d. Available Hotkeys:
   - `Alt+S`: Toggle speech input
   - `Alt+P`: Pause/Resume all services
   - `Alt+Q`: Quit

Each service needs to run in its own terminal window. Make sure MongoDB and Neo4j are running before starting the services.
